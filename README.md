# Greatest_Common_Divisor
Finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers, as explored by Euclid:  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm  

Quoting from Wikipedia:  
_"It can be used to reduce fractions to their simplest form, and is a part of many other number-theoretic and cryptographic calculations. The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number."_  

This is currently work-in-progress...
